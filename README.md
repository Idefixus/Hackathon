# Hackathon
Hi we are participating in the german hackathon for corona and this is our project

## Requirements
- The project is located at https://github.com/Idefixus/Hackathon/tree/master/hackathon (The hackathon subfolder, which should lie at the root of your server)
- XAMPP or PHP server and SQL Database
- Create a Database with the Query 'wissensdatenbank3.sql' (It doesnt create the DB itself only the tables you have to create one on your own and then run the script to get default data and structure)
- Fill the credentials.php with the necessary data.
- Run the website and you can be happy
